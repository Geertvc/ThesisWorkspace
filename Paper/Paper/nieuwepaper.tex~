When rendering using Monte Carlo methods, either a large amount of samples are necessary or noise will be present in the image.
A lot of methods have already tried to tackle this problem including adaptive sampling, reconstruction techniques and advanced image filtering techniques.
In this paper I will recapitulate the work I have done for my thesis so far. 
The focus will be on the RPF algorithm called random parameter filtering (RPF) as proposed in ~\cite{RPF11}.
As this algorithm is based on a cross bilateral filter, this concept will be explained and discussed as well.
To conclude, some other methods that handle the noise caused by Monte Carlo rendering at low sampling rates were investigated as well.

\section{Introduction}
\todo{de beschrijving van het probleem, welk probleem lost je op, waarom is dit een belangrijk probleem}

Computer Graphics has evolved from 2D to almost realistic 3D during the last decennia.
To reach this realism in graphics, Global Illumination algorithms became very important, 
these incorporate the indirect light caused by the surroundings.
These algorithms require large numbers of calculations and thus a large rendering time, especially when results without noise are expected.
To lower this rendering time, Monte Carlo methods are often used because they can be used to evaluate multidimensional functions in an unbiased way.
Complex and photorealistic images can be created using these Monte Carlo methods.
In the case of (Monte Carlo) rendering, the multidimensional equation that needs to be solved is the rendering equation. 
\todo{put in the rendering equation}
As Monte Carlo methods take random samples to evaluate a function, a lot of samples are usually necessary to evaluate the function precisely and 
thus a lot of noise will be present when using a low number of samples. 
One obvious solution to this problem is to use more samples, 
but as the rendering time increases dramatically with the amount of samples this is not always an option.
Adaptive sampling algorithms can then be used to distribute these (sometimes large) numbers of samples in the best possible way across the image.
Reconstruction techniques can also be used to suppress the number of samples, 
as these try to use the available samples as much as possible, across pixels and even across frames.
Another technique that can be used is the focus of this paper and is an advanced image filter, 
it uses not only the color computed at each sample of the image, 
but also other parameters that are available during the rendering process, to filter the image.

More information about Monte Carlo methods can be found here~\cite{kalos2009monte}, 
while more information about advanced rendering can be found here~\cite{dutr√©2006advanced} and here \cite{pharr2010physically}.
Some recent work that try to tackle the problem of noise at low sampling rates when using Monte Carlo rendering are discussed below.

\todo{2010: integration  Compressive estimation for signal integration in rendering}
While Monte Carlo methods are used to evaluate functions, 
other methods like the one explained in ~\cite{Sen:CompressiveSignalEstimation:2010} can also be used to compute the integral of an unknown function.
This is possible because of the theory of compressed sensing, which allows to reconstruct a signal from a few linear samples if it is sparse in a transform domain.
This method can also be used to compute computer graphics distribution effects like anti-aliasing and motion blur.
The advantage of this function over Monte Carlo methods is that is needs only a few samples to estimate the function.
\\

\todo{Temporal Light Field Reconstruction for Rendering Distribution Effects}
A general reconstruction technique that tries to maximize the image quality based on a given set of samples is given in ~\cite{Lehtinen2011sg}.
This technique exploits the dependencies in the temporal light field and allows efficient reuse of samples between different pixels.
The effective sampling rate is multiplied by a large factor when using this technique.
\\
\todo{Reconstruction the Indirect Light Field for Global Illumination}

\todo{2012: adaptive filtering -- Axis-Aligned Filtering for Interactive Sampled Soft Shadows}
The post-processing step needed in Light Field Reconstruction techniques is very expensive.
Other algorithms like the one proposed in ~\cite{UdayMehta:2012:AAF} has a very simple filtering step by using axis-aligned filters.
Because of this extremely simple step, this algorithm can be integrated in real-time raytracers.
Adaptive filtering is used because the parameters of the used filters are adjusted depending on the input samples.
This algorithm is basically an image filter for noise that is fixed on the soft shadows effect.
\\
\todo{2012: adaptive sampling -- Adaptive Rendering with Non-Local Means Filtering}
The following algorithm found in ~\cite{Rousselle:2012:ARN:2366145.2366214} describes an adaptive sampling algorithm for Monte Carlo rendering.
An adaptive sampling algorithm tries to determine the optimal sample distribution across the image.
This can be done by allocating more samples to regions with difficult light effects.
The first step of the algorithm distributes a given budget of samples over the image after which the image is filtered in the second step of the algorithm with a variant of the NL-means filter which is a generalisation of the bilateral filter.
This filter considers distances between pairs of pixel values to compute filter weights, the term non-local is caused by the fact that the set of samples that contribute to one output pixel can come from a large region in the input image.
In the third step of the algorithm the remaining error in the filtered image is estimated to drive the adaptive sampling in the next iteration step.
\\
\todo{2008: adaptive sampling -- Multidimensional Adaptive Sampling and Reconstruction for Ray Tracing}
A combination of adaptive sampling and reconstruction is proposed in ~\cite{Hachisuka:2008:MAS:1360612.1360632}.
This paper introduces a new sampling strategy for ray tracing.
The samples on which the strategy operates are generated from the rendering equation directly and are thus not generated through Monte Carlo sampling.
Additionally this algorithm uses all previously generated samples to generate a new sample.
After sampling this high-dimensional function, a reconstruction is made by integrating the function over all but the image dimensions.
